# Digitalclock-without-switch-using-8051-microcontroller
A digital clock is one that displays time digitally. The circuit explained here displays time with two ‘minutes’ digits and two ‘seconds’ digits on four seven segment displays. The seven segment and switches are interfaced with 8051 microcontroller AT89C51. This circuit can be used in cars, houses, offices etc.
